# A Node.js API Authentication With JWT
This is a node.js api that is going to handle Authentication for me in any application i want to use it in.

The authentication method used jwt. I used mongodb as my database, mongoose to create models and to connect to my express server, bcryptjs to hash passwords and jwt to check for private routes.
